        The Ice Tilt Hockey League (ITHL) was born out of a passion for
        competitive gaming and a love for hockey. Established during the early
        days of the COVID-19 pandemic in the spring of 2020, the ITHL started
        with a simple idea: to create a space where groups of friends could
        bring their own clubs and compete in a fun, friendly environment. At the
        time, no such leagues existed, so we took to Twitter to find clubs
        interested in playing friendly best-of-three series. What started as
        casual matches quickly grew into something much bigger. Our inaugural
        season featured just seven clubs. However, as word spread and more
        players found us, the league expanded rapidlyâ€”first to 13 clubs, then
        20, and now, we proudly host over 60 clubs from across North America and
        Europe. The ITHL was created with one goal in mind: to provide a
        platform where friends could enjoy competitive NHL gaming together,
        regardless of skill level. Unlike other leagues that emphasize
        high-stakes competition, the ITHL has always prioritized fun and
        inclusivity. We believe that everyone should have the chance to compete,
        improve, and, most importantly, have fun. Community engagement is at the
        heart of what we do. We actively connect with our players through social
        media, league events, and game broadcasts. Our aim is to foster a
        community where players not only enjoy the thrill of competition but
        also build lasting friendships with fellow gamers from around the world.
        Now, over four years since our first puck drop, the ITHL has hosted more
        than 25 events and seasons. As we continue to grow, our commitment
        remains the same: to create a welcoming, competitive, and fun
        environment for all hockey gamers. with the original logo posted bt it
